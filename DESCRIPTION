Description: MusicBrainz is an open music encyclopedia that collects music 
    metadata and makes it available to the public. MusicBrainz aims to be: 
    1) The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute 
    and releasing the data under open licenses. 
    2) The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous 
    form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have 
    meaningful conversations about music. Visit <https://musicbrainz.org> for 
    further information.
